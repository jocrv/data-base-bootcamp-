Data sctructure
vector and matrices (headquarters) //
register

what's a data structure:  is a structuree from data of memory for computer or any dispositive to stack up, with the correctly way to use this data with the right way. This structure are using for a lot application os developmento for systems, and some of them are specialixxed and to specifyc tasks. We are using the correct structure by algorithms to work with data quantitty like applications to search. 
one algortih is a group of estructure instructions and ordered to some goal or to do some task or specific operation. The algorithms are use to manager data on structures for a lot ways, for example: insert, exclude, search and ordered data. 
Algorithms: in some data structure we need to know how toe some group of basic operations, for example: insert data, exclude data, locate some element, process all the itens which constitue the structure to vise. Classify the resume to stock the itens in data for a determine order ( numeric, alfabetic ) // Principal structure of data: arrays (vectors and headquartes), register, list, stock, row, three, table hash, graphs

## arrays: vector anthe heardquart are structure from data simple to help when a lot of variable are available at the same algorithm. portugol-webstudio.cubos.io/ide // you can create the variable and insert the name1, name2, name4, name5. for example this structure // Vector or array is an unidimensional for a variable to save a lot of variables from the same type. The vector is a structure from data index, to save a determine quantity from values from one type. 

program{
    funcao inicio() {
        inteiro numeros[] = {39,45,54,55}

        escreva(numero[0])
    }
}

programa{
    funcao inicio() {
        inteiro numero[] = {39,45,54,55}

        para(inteiro posicao = 0; posicao <=3; posicao++){
            escreva(numeros[posicao], " ")
        }
    }
}

programa
{
    funcao inicrio()
    {
        inteiro vetor[] = {1,3,5,7,9} // Criar o vetor com valor 
        inteiro numero
        logico achou = falso // variável para apenas o resultado
        
        escreva("Qual número deseja procuraR?")
        leia(numero

        // criacao dos vetores, já com os dadosados
        cadeia nome[] = { "Andrew", "Tiffany", "Bianca", "Susan", "Cameron"}
        real altura[] = { 1.71, 1.78, 1.75, 1.87, 1.71}

        // created a top from this table
        escreva("---------------\n")
        escreva("    TABELA     \n")
        escreva("----------------\n")
    }
}

para(inteiro posicao = 0; posicao <5; posicao++)
{

    // o the special character \t serve to write one table

}

Headquarte or array multi dimensiona is a vector from vectores. The headquarter is a vector which had two or more dimensions. 

programa
{
    inclua biblioteca Util --> u
    funcao inicio()
    {
        // define the dimension (row and columns) from headquarte
        const inteiro TAMANHO= 5
        // created the quarterhead
        inteiro[TAMANHO][TAMANHO]

        para (inteiro linha = 0; linha < TAMANHO; linha++)
        {
            para(inteiro coluna = 0; coluna < TAMANHO; coluna++)
            {
                [linha][coluna] = u.sorteia(1,9) /// atribute the random value fot this headquarter
                escreva("[", matrixx[linha][coluna], "]")  /// exibition of the value contain in position of heardquarter
            }
            escreva("\n")
        }
    }
}

Register: register is a structure with a special format specialixxed to store the informations on memory. While Arrays allow store data from a just ony type data, resources of register on allow store from more than one type of data.  example cpf, number, text... One register is composed with fields with specify each one of this information which composed itself. Above some fields for example which constited some register from costumers:
cpf
name
address
contact
## we can mixxed differents numbers in some register

all structure have one name for example a book, and the fields, it could acess by some quite of using operation point(.) For example, to acess the price of some book, we could using this declaration: 
book.price

algorithm
//declare the type of data
type
structure_book = register
name : character
price : real
page : integer
endregister
//delcare the variables
i integer
book array[1...3] from structure_book

Write("Among names, price and number of pages from three books")
for i from 2 to 3 do //lecture the data
Read(book[i]. name, book[i].pages)
endto
Write("This is data typed")
to i from 1 to 3 do
Write(livro[i] name[i] price, book[i]. pages)
endto
ENDALGORITHM

lists, 
stack(fila)
queu (pilha)
lists: the difference among list and arrays is the list have fixxe sixxe ajustable, and array have fix sixe. Tha array, squarehart, the list doesn't need to start with the fix value, it could increase or decrease. Exists two types: singly, doubly and circula linked list. The list singlys existe node, is like a index, but the node in list knowing the value wich are stock inside besides that knowing the element after this: that's the reason why it know the list singly because the node are indicated with one is the next node. The list singly the firste node, the node, the last node. After this if the laste node are removed it come back to the first node.  First node("Pedro") next node("Joana"). The list are variable, the list of name for some party. 
The list doubly:  if you put some value before the first value. this list you can connect with the. The big difference between list doubly are bidirectly. You can go to forward on list connect because the node from list connect know which is the next element. On this type of list the node know which is the nexte element and the element forward this allow with the reverse navigation. 
queu: is a data structure which serves to coolet the elements, and allow just for one item for data stored. The allow this itens of stack is restrict, for a item which could be read or delete one time. Exists two type of queu, LIFO(UEPS) or FIFO(PEPS) / lifo structure is the Last in First Out or (UEPS ultimo que entra primeiro que sai) that presentes the foolow criteria the first element to be delete is the last to be insert. This stack LIFO the last which insert. The other type stack FIFO the criteria the first element to be eliminated ir the first which is insert. (lifo: empyt stach - push(1) push (1)(2) pop (2)(1)) (pop-remove)  FIFO(enqueu (1)(2) enqueue(1)(2)(3) enqueue(1)(2)(3)(4)(5) enqueue(1(2(3(4(5(6)))))))  dequeue (pop (1)  dequeue (pop(2)) dequeue (pop(3) dequeue (pop(4) dequeue(pop(5)

Stack: this structure admites the remove of elements and insert new things to this follow rule: the element is remove and the one of the structure got more time to be insert on stack and it'll be the first to be remove (the concept of FIFO) the first (1)(2)(3)

Non linear data structure: Graph data structure, tree data structure hash table data structure
data structure:

tree data structure: is a structure organixxe where the elements are putting in hierachical the elements stay on the top, rotts, and the suborninates  as node or leaves. Whe studied vector: the number, positions/ how we can do this search, we can search step by step to find the number 15. the set passed to find the number 15, imagine find the number 16 (doesn't exist on table) the vector when areed increased, make easy the search but it not always like this, sometimes the values are difused. find in the middle, like you know everything are ordering, the vector will find the middle, and forget the next guys he knows doesn't have any vector at right. to make easy the tree structure, like in the list singly (every number are one different vector) the roots is always the middles, they will serach the subtree, they try the root, it will upp and serach the subtree, make easy this structures, make dad and babies. like a tree. like a roots and leaves and // at computeacional this structure is inverse. 

table hash: is a dispersion or mirror from a structure of data special with associated the search of values. The table hash is a generalixxation of ideai from array, but using the function named hashing to share elements, doing with the same at the same way non ordering inside the "array" defines the table. hashing: null, B, null, A, null, E, null, null, D, C, null. The hash table allow associated the "value"with the keys. The values is the position or index where the elements are find. The key is a part of information which composed the element to be manager. // Share make the search easy on data structure because the key could acess the faster way the position "array". 

graphs: is a structure to allow programming the relation among objects. the objects are vertices or node from graphs. The relations are edges. Any position could be manager, like one person could move to any position, to right, to the left, horixxontal, vertical. To advance search you could using this structure.
